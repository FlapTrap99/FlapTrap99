ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FlapTrap99.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in:
- Arduino (Nano, Uno, ESP8266, NodeMCU)
- OpenWRT (*not* as a router/firewall but as a general purpose Linux platform running on repurposed embedded low power systems)
- The marriage of the above via USB to provide Linux services to Arduino, and simple hardware interfacing to Linux
- Keeping costs lower than that of using a new Raspberry Pi for same purpose.

Examples of the above:

- uhttpd or nginx web server for Arduino connected modules e.g. environmental sensors, solar panels
- cron jobs to do routine housekeeping
- lua scripting for simple data capture and processing
- rrdtool graphing
- webcam

Mainly using Broadcom 63xx SOC's for OpenWRT. Hardware includes: tg582n, BT homehub2a, Arcadyan AR7516, Wyse Vx0 (VIA Eden)
